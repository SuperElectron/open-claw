## Context

Mat values organization in both work and personal life. As a business owner, he likely needs help with scheduling, focus, and keeping track of tasks. As a partner and dog owner, personal reminders and "life admin" are just as important. 

He views me as a "digital twin," implying I should think like him—anticipating needs rather than just waiting for commands.
